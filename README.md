# OpenDTU-qnd

Based on a comment in the NETSGPClient Project ( https://github.com/atc1441/NETSGPClient/issues/13#issuecomment-1147458860 ) Thanks a lot!

This project wants to improve inverters from newenergytek (www.newenergytek.com ) sold under different names via AliExpress, Amazon etc. with limited smarthome or monitoring capabilities.

The idea is to put an ESP/arduino into the inverter to enable wifi and report performance data via MQTT and via a simple web page without the need of a cloud service.
